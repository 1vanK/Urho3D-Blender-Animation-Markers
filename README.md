Animation markers exporter for Urho3D Engine (support "All actions")
Version: 1.0

This is Blender addon for helps you create event animation markers (Blender markers -> Urho3D trigges)
Blender has two(?) type markers:
1. local (Actions markers)
2. scenes (whole scene timeline marker)
(3. nla?)

Both types markers saves with this addon.
